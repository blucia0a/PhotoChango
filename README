PhotoChango - Brandon Lucia - 2011

Overview:
---------
PhotoChango is a program to convert video captured from a camera connected to
your computer into sound, produced in the style of the Chango
(https://github.com/blucia0a/Chango).  I wrote this software to render a music/dance composition that I am planning to write.  

Installation:
-------------
Download the source files to some directory.  In that directory, run 'make',
and the project should build.  There are some deprecated API warnings emitted
by the CoreAudio library -- they are safe to ignore.  Run ./PhotoChango in the
installation directory, and you should see video and hear sound.  Yay!

Implementation Notes:
---------------------
The video capture support is implemented using OpenCV
(opencv.willowgarage.com), and the audio support is implemented using the OS X
core audio framework.  It is in the TODO for this project to add
an abstraction layer, supporting multiple mode of audio support
